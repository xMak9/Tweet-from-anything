1. Open "main.py" in VSC (or any program where you can edit text)

2. Get your "Consumer key" and "Consumer key secret" from your twitter app @ https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/apps/

3. Get your "Bearer Token" and "Bearer token secret" key from the link above

4. Replace the "CONSUMER KEY HERE", "CONSUMER KEY SECRET HERE" with the consumers keys you just got

5. Replace the "BEARER TOKEN HERE", "BEARER TOKEN SECRET HERE" with the bearer keys you just got

6. Run "main.py"

6. Conjure up a tweet

7. All set!

~ Now if you check your tweets on https://twitter.com/ you will see you tweeted whatever you wrote in "main.py"
~~ If you check the tweet you will say it was tweeted from "Twitter for (whatever you named your app)"
